Step 1 – Open your browser’s extension/add-ons manager
In Chrome: Type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar and press Enter. In Firefox: Press Ctrl+Shift+A or type about:addons. Navigate to Extensions to view all installed extensions.
Step 2 – Review all installed extensions carefully
Check each extension’s name, icon, publisher, and description. Flag anything unfamiliar, unused, or suspicious.
Step 3 – Check permissions and reviews
In Chrome, click Details under an extension to see permissions. Look for high-risk permissions like 'Read and change all your data on all websites'. Check ratings and reviews in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons site.
Step 4 – Identify suspicious or unused extensions
Categorize each extension: Keep, Remove, or Test Later based on trust, necessity, and permissions.
Step 5 – Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions
In Chrome, click Remove under the extension and confirm. In Firefox, use the three-dot menu → Remove.
Step 6 – Restart browser and check for performance improvements
Close all browser windows completely, then reopen. Check if speed, stability, and security improved.
Step 7 – Research how malicious extensions can harm users
Malicious extensions can steal data, hijack sessions, inject ads, track browsing, mine cryptocurrency, or spread malware.
Step 8 – Document steps taken and extensions removed
Keep a log with Date, Browser, Extension Name, Action, and Reason for removal or retention
